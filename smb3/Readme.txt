This is the first working version of an AI I am working on. 
It is mainly to show people how a computer can learn to do a task via a very simple algorithm.
If it crashes or the fitness is incorrect please let me know. I have only tested this on world 1 so far.
To get it to work follow these steps.

step1: Download FCEUX and acquire a smb3 rom

step2: Extract the contents of the smb3 folder into the FCEUX folder.

step3: Boot up FCEUX and go to the overworld as player 1 (you can also do it as player 2 but then you got the change the Player variable in the beginning of luigio-smb3.lua file.

step4: create a savestate of the overworld in slot 1

step5: launch luigio-launcher.lua and enter a level.

If you want to edit the code mid run edit the "interrupt.lua" file.

For any questions about the other files just ask me on discord
