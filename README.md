Transparency:
This program has been modified/improved/developed with the use of AIs like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Almost entirely so.

What:
This is a NEAT program that learns to play Super Mario Bros. (1985) known as MarioBot. There is also another version of the program that learns to play Super Mario Bros. 3 known as LuigI/O.

These program were first developed by two people on youtube called Akisame, who first developed LuigI/O as I knew it which was improved on from another program called MarI/O created by SethBling, and Electra, though there is not much I know about this person
other than the fact that she helped Akisame develop LuigI/O.

These programs are written as a lua plugin for an emulator called FCEUX.

The version for Super Mario Bros. 3 is entirely untouuched solely because I enjoy the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros. more than Super Mario Bros. 3. In other words, this repo is specialized in the development of the "MarioBot"

Why:
I, personally, throught that this program was cool, very interesting, and enjoyable to watch when a youtuber (https://www.youtube.com/@LuigIO) was streaming it several years ago, and I would have liked it if LuigI/O would have done ROM hacks instead of moving
onto Super Mario Bros. 3.

Goal:
The goal that I have in mind for this program is to develop it to the point that this program is able to learn to beat kaizo ROM hacks of Super Mario Bros. (1985).

I'm not certain of the limitations of the NEAT approach to these problems (i.e. if it's possible at all), but I would still like to develop and advance the program to get as close as possible to (consistently) beating these kinds of ROM hacks 
created by the ROM hacking community.

Limitations (to overcome):
The current limitations of the program I have found (although not too specifically) are:
-Being unable to beat levels and/or ROMs that are not linear. i.e. if the level involves going left or back and forth, then the program is unlikely to beat the level/game unless I resort to an ungodly amount of hardcoding to get the job done which would defeat
 the purpose of this program.
-Unable to beat levels/games that are overly difficult in nature like kaizo hacks. To give a more concrete example, there is a ROM hack of Super Mario Bros. called Super Mario Forever, more commonly known (I think) as Super Mario Frustration. This should give
 a clear understanding of what I mean by "overly difficult."
